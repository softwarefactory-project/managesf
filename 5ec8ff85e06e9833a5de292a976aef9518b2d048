      "message": "That\u0027s not true because there is already a support for storyboard. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s correct to set the resources interface at this level. Instead it seems more logical to me to move only that content https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/gitweb?p\u003dsoftware-factory/managesf.git;a\u003dtree;f\u003dmanagesf/model/yamlbkd/resources;h\u003d10885adfbfe51d914a4d1134aa91928d57185d96;hb\u003dHEAD. For instance code in gitacl.py is 100% Gerrit so I think we can have gitacl.py that is just w wrapper to resources/services/sfgerrit.py:ACL. Same for gitrepository.py, we can keep that file as a wrapper and have resources/services/sfgerrit:REPO and if expect to have a github, gitlab, whatever support later we can then have resources/services/github.py:REPO/ACL ?\nLet\u0027s discuss tomorrow.",
