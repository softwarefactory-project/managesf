      "message": "That\u0027s not true because there is already a support for storyboard. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s correct to set the resources interface at this level. Instead it seems more logical to me to move only that content https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/gitweb?p\u003dsoftware-factory/managesf.git;a\u003dtree;f\u003dmanagesf/model/yamlbkd/resources;h\u003d10885adfbfe51d914a4d1134aa91928d57185d96;hb\u003dHEAD. For instance code in gitacl.py is 100% Gerrit so I think we can have gitacl.py that is just w wrapper to resources/services/sfgerrit.py:ACL. Same for gitrepository.py, we can keep that file as a wrapper and have resources/services/sfgerrit:REPO and if expect to have a github, gitlab, whatever support later we can then have resources/services/github.py:REPO/ACL ?\nLet\u0027s discuss tomorrow.",

      "message": "My bad, I forgot about Storyboard (I wonder why...)\nI\u0027ll rename this module to managesf.py to be more generic, since it does use the managesf resource backend, and it\u0027ll be the loaded plugin by default.\n\nSince the resource apply is done at the engine level we\u0027ll introduce a plugin structure there to support different services later (like we discussed a while ago), as I don\u0027t want to break more things than needed for now.",
